Introduction
============

This sample plugin enables Orthanc to serve DICOM modality worklists
that are read from some folder.

Whenever a C-Find SCP request is issued to Orthanc, it will read the
content of this folder to locate the worklists that match the request.
An external application can dynamically modify the content of this
folder while Orthanc is running to add/remove worklists.

This sample mimics the behavior of the "wlmscpfs" tool from the
DCMTK package:

Compilation for Linux
=====================

# mkdir Build
# cd Build
# cmake ..
# make


Cross-compilation for Windows using MinGW
=========================================

# mkdir Build
# cd Build
# cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../../Resources/MinGWToolchain.cmake
# make


Configuration
=============

First, generate the default configuration of Orthanc:
https://orthanc.chu.ulg.ac.be/book/users/configuration.html

Then, modify the "Plugins" option to point to the folder containing
the built plugins. Finally, create a section "ModalityWorklists" in
the configuration file to configure the worklist server. If using the
build commands above, a sample configuration would read as follows:

{
  [...]
  "Plugins" : [ 
    "."
  ],
  "Worklists" : {
    "Enable": true,
    "Database": "../WorklistsDatabase"
  }
}

The folder "WorklistsDatabase" contains a database of sample
worklists, that come from the DCMTK source distribution, as described
in the FAQ entry #37 of the DCMTK project:
