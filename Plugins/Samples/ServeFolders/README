Introduction
============

This sample plugin enables Orthanc to serve additional folders using
its embedded Web server.


Compilation for Linux
=====================

# mkdir Build
# cd Build
# cmake ..
# make


Cross-compilation for Windows using MinGW
=========================================

# mkdir Build
# cd Build
# cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../../Resources/MinGWToolchain.cmake
# make


Configuration
=============

First, generate the default configuration of Orthanc:
https://orthanc.chu.ulg.ac.be/book/users/configuration.html

Then, modify the "Plugins" option to point to the folder containing
the built plugins.

Finally, create a section "ServeFolders" in the configuration file to
specify which folder you want to serve, and at which URI. For
instance, the following excerpt would load the plugins from the
working directory, then would branch the content of the folder
"/home/jodogne/WWW/fosdem" as the URI "http://localhost:8042/fosdem":

{
  "Name" : "MyOrthanc",
  [...]
  "HttpPort" : 8042,
  [...]
  "Plugins" : [ 
    "."
  ],
  "ServeFolders" : {
    "/fosdem" : "/home/jodogne/WWW/fosdem"
  }
}
