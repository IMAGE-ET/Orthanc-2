Licensing
---------

Orthanc is licensed under the GPLv3 license, with the OpenSSL
exception:
http://people.gnome.org/~markmc/openssl-and-the-gpl.html

Because Orthanc uses the Software-as-a-Service paradigm, commercial
products are allowed to access the Orthanc REST services and to bundle
Orthanc in an commercial aggregate.

We also kindly require scientific works and clinical studies that make
use of Orthanc to cite Orthanc in their associated publications.


Licensing of special directories
--------------------------------

The following directories have separate licensing terms:

* The files of the "OrthancCppClient/" directory are licensed under
  the MIT license, which allows commercial products to statically link
  against the C++ client library.

* The file of the "Core/SQLite/" directory are licensed under the
  3-clause BSD license, as they are derived from the Chromium project.
