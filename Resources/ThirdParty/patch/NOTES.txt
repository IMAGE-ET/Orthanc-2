INFORMATION
===========

This is a precompiled version of the "patch" standard tool for
Windows. It was compiled using the MSYS framework.

The binaries originate from the "Git for Windows 1.9.5" package
(https://msysgit.github.io/). The build instructions have been
provided on the discussion group of Git for Windows [1]. They are
copied/pasted below for reference.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS [1]
======================

The easiest way to find out about this is to install the Git SDK, then 
run 

     pacman -Qu $(which patch.exe) 

to find out which package contains the `patch.exe` binary. It so happens 
to be patch.2.7.5-1 at the moment. Since this is an MSys2 package (not a 
MinGW one, otherwise the patch utility would be in /mingw64/bin/, not 
/usr/bin/), this package is built from the recipes in 

     https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages 

The `patch` package is obviously built from the subdirectory 

     https://github.com/Alexpux/MSYS2-packages/tree/master/patch 

and the PKGBUILD file specifies that the source is fetched from 
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/patch/patch-2.7.5.tar.xz: 

https://github.com/Alexpux/MSYS2-packages/blob/900744becd072f687029b0f830ab6fe95cf533d6/patch/PKGBUILD#L14 

and then these two patches are applied before building: 
     
https://github.com/Alexpux/MSYS2-packages/blob/900744becd072f687029b0f830ab6fe95cf533d6/patch/msys2-patch-2.7.1.patch 

and 
      
https://github.com/Alexpux/MSYS2-packages/blob/900744becd072f687029b0f830ab6fe95cf533d6/patch/msys2-patch-manifest.patch 

As you can see, some light changes are applied, i.e. `patch.exe` will 
always write in binary mode with MSys2, and the executable will have a 
manifest embedded that allows it to run as non-administrator.
