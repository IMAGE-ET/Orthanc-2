This is a precompiled version of the "patch" standard tool for Windows
(version 2.6.1). It was cross-compiled as follows under Linux thanks
to MinGW32:

# wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/patch/patch-2.6.1.tar.gz
# tar xvfz patch-2.6.1.tar.gz
# patch -p0 < fix-sources.patch 
# cd patch-2.6.1
# ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc
# make
# cd ..
# cp patch-2.6.1/src/patch.exe .
# i586-mingw32msvc-strip ./patch.exe
