This is a precompiled version of the "patch" standard tool for Windows
(version 2.5.9). It was cross-compiled as follows under Linux thanks
to MinGW32:

# wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/patch/patch-2.5.9.tar.gz
# tar xvfz patch-2.5.9.tar.gz
# cd patch-2.5.9
# ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc
# make
# cd ..
# cp patch-2.5.9/patch.exe .
# i586-mingw32msvc-strip ./patch.exe
