Static linking for OS X using XCode
===================================

The most simple way of building Orthanc under OS X consists in
statically linking against all the third-party dependencies. In this
case, no package manager such as Homebrew or MacPorts is required.
The build tool (CMake) will download the sources of all the required
packages and automatically compile them.


Prerequisites
-------------

1) XCode must be installed.

2) CMake must be installed (http://www.cmake.org/).

3) It is assumed that Orthanc source code is placed in the folder
   "~/Orthanc" and that the binaries will be compiled to
   "~/OrthancBuild".


Prepare the build with CMake
----------------------------

# cd ~/OrthancBuild
# cmake -GXcode -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.8 -DSTATIC_BUILD=ON -DSTANDALONE_BUILD=ON ..

NB: Adapt the value of "CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET" with respect to
your version of XCode.


Build the Debug version of Orthanc
----------------------------------

# xcodebuild
# ./Debug/UnitTests

The binaries of Orthanc are located at "~/OrthancBuild/Debug/Orthanc".


Build the Release version of Orthanc
------------------------------------

# xcodebuild -configuration Release
# ./Debug/UnitTests

The binaries of Orthanc are located at "~/OrthancBuild/Release/Orthanc".
